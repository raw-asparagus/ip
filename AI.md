## [2025-01-24] Learned Logging with AI Assistance

I used a generative AI tool to learn how to do more robust logging in Java.  
Previously, I relied on e.printStackTrace(), but IntelliJ IDEA warning threw a
warning:

```text
Call to 'printStackTrace()' should probably be replaced with more robust logging
```

ChatGPT showed me how to use `java.util.logging` (`Logger`, `Level`, etc.)
instead.
