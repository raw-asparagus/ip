## [2025-01-24] Learned Logging with AI Assistance

I discovered how to implement robust logging in Java by consulting a generative AI tool. Previously, I had been using
`e.printStackTrace()`, but IntelliJ IDEA alerted me that this method should be replaced with a more sophisticated
logging technique.

Guided by ChatGPT, I transitioned to using `java.util.logging`, employing classes such as `Logger` and `Level` for a
more reliable and maintainable logging solution.

## [2025-02-22] Enhanced Documentation & Unit Testing with AI Assistance

(After iP submission)

I leveraged ChatGPT o3 Mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to improve my project in two significant ways:

- **Javadoc Enhancement:**  
  The AI tools provided guidance on writing comprehensive Javadocs, ensuring that my methods, parameters, and return
  values are clearly documented. This effort helped in making the codebase more maintainable and understandable for both
  current and future developers.

- **Improved Unit Testing with Mockito:**  
  By following the insightful suggestions from the AI, I refined the unit tests by effectively incorporating Mockito for
  mocking dependencies. This led to more robust tests that accurately simulate different scenarios, improving the
  overall reliability of the tests.

These enhancements have contributed to a well-documented and thoroughly tested codebase.
